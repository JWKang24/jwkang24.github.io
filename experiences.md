    description: -[RideFlux Inc.](https://www.eng.rideflux.com/){:target="_blank"} (07/2023 ~ 07/2024) <br> I developed, verified, and maintained Planning/Prediction features for autonomous vehicles using C++ and ROS. Specifically, my role was to improve the decision-making and prediction performance by using additional information, such as road structures and previous decisions. One of my significant projects involved integrating a function to handle potential road users in obstructed areas without making the vehicle overly conservative. <br> During this period, the company achieved the first unmanned vehicle license in South Korea, and I contributed by developing features for safe lane changes, Operational Design Domain(ODD) checking, etc.

    description: -[Seoul National University Soft Robotics & Bionics Laboratory](https://softrobotics.snu.ac.kr/){:target="_blank"}, Prof. Yong-Lae Park (07/2021 ~ 02/2023) <br>This work involved designing and fabricating a multi-functional soft-bending actuator and a control system for the actuator from scratch. Using optic fiber as a main material, this actuator is able to have variable stiffness through fiber jamming and proprioceptive sensing through fiber optics. <br> With this work, I co-authored the article [“Soft Bending Actuator with Fiber-Jamming Variable Stiffness and Fiber-Optic Proprioception”](https://softrobotics.snu.ac.kr/publications/KangJW_IEEE_RAL_2023.pdf){:target="_blank"} for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters. Also, I [presented](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C2o_W6JpSGKyRWnGFJG5yHXB3NW92DDT/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} this work at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation.

    description: -[Seoul National University Photonics Systems Laboratory](https://stargate.snu.ac.kr/overview){:target="_blank"}, Prof. Namkyoo Park (07/2022 ~ 06/2023) <br>I adapted and tested a drone control algorithm, [‘Neural-Fly'](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.abm6597){:target="_blank"}, which enables robust flying under wind effect, in an Airsim simulator using Python. I started by constructing a simulator environment and collecting data to train and evaluate the neural network used in the algorithm. Utilizing inputs and outputs from the simulator, I coded the control algorithm introduced in the original paper. I could demonstrate that the performance of the rebuilt algorithm is close to that of the original paper.

    description: -[Seoul National University Biorobotics Laboratory](https://www.biorobotics.snu.ac.kr/){:target="_blank"}, Prof. Kyu-Jin Cho (01/2021 ~ 06/2021) <br> As an Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) participant, I worked on improving a prototype of an active hamstring assisting wearable, starting with fabricating the whole structure again with several design improvements for user comfort. <br>Through separate experiments, I figured that the mechanical delay is the main reason for the lack of assistance during gait with fast speed. To address this issue, I developed a PID control algorithm for a faster motor and explored the idea of predicting gait states using encoder output, allowing for earlier activation of assistance.
