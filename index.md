<p>
Welcome!<br> I am a robotics engineer with an interdisciplinary background in both hardware and software development. I have a strong interest in creating robotic systems that can operate reliably in diverse and unstructured environments.
<br> <br> 
Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://me.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford University</a>. During my undergraduate studies at Seoul National University, I majored in both <a href="https://me.snu.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank">Mechanical Engineering</a> and <a href="https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en" target="_blank">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>.
<br> <br> 
I enjoy solving real-world problems through discussions that include diverse perspectives, and I am eager to explore new opportunities!
