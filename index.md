<p>
Welcome!<br> I am a robotics engineer with an interdisciplinary background in both hardware and software development. I have a strong interest in creating robotic systems that can operate reliably in diverse and unstandardized environments.
<br> <br> 
Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University. During my undergraduate studies at Seoul National University, I majored in both Mechanical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering.
<br> <br> 
I enjoy solving real-world problems through discussions that include diverse perspectives, and I am eager to explore new opportunities!
