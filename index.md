<p>
  Welcome! <br> I am Joonwon Kang, a Robotics engineer with an interdisciplinary background both in hardware and software development. I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University. During my undergraduate studies at Seoul National University, I majored in both Mechanical Engineering (ME) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). I love solving real-world problems through discussions with different perspectives.
